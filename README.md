# macscripts

Updater for MacOS, homebrew, and pip. Configurable and simple.

## Dependencies

Stock MacOS (version >=10.15) includes the required dependencies which are zsh and bash. Of course the homebrew and pip functions won't work if you don't install those optional dependencies.

## Install

``
$ git clone https://github.com/jackiehobson/macscripts && cd macscripts && ./install.sh
``

## Devs

Pull requests welcom. Bash is used only just cause I'm more familiar with it than zsh. Plus syntax won't change at all since bash is frozen in MacOS due to licensing issues.
